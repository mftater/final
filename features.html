            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The system allows users to add events, view their calendar, and share events with family members. All features are working except sharing events and the admin page.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Front-End Features</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>1. Event Creation </h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Users can create new events by filling in a form with event details (title, description, date, time).</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working. The event is added to the calendar successfully, with validation ensuring that required fields (title, date, and time) are filled.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>2. Event Display</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Events are displayed in the user's calendar.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working. Events are shown correctly on the calendar after being added with accurate date, time, and title.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>3. Share Event Checkbox</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Users can select a checkbox to share an event with their family members.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working, but <strong>shared events functionality is currently not working</strong>. Although the checkbox allows event sharing, shared events are not being saved properly.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>4. Family Member Dropdown</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Users can select family members from a dropdown list when creating or sharing an event.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working. The dropdown populates with family members from the back-end, and users can select multiple family members to share the event with via Id.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Back-End Features</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>1. User Authentication</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Users must be authenticated to create events or view their calendar.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working. Users can log in and access their account. The system ensures that only logged-in users can access protected routes (event creation, calendar view).</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>2. Event Insertion</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Events are stored in the database when a user creates them.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working. Events are successfully inserted into the `events` table.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>3. Shared Events Insertion</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> If the user selects the option to share an event, it should be saved in the `shared_events` table.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Not Working. Shared events are not being saved to the `shared_events` table despite the form submitting data for family members. Debugging required.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>4. Family Connections</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Family members who are connected and have an `approved` status are retrieved to show in the dropdown list.</p>
                    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Working. The `family_connections` table is queried to fetch approved family members and display them in the front-end dropdown.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Issues and Next Steps</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>1. Shared Events Not Saving</h3>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Shared events are not being saved into the `shared_events` table, even though the checkbox is checked and family members are selected.</p>
                    <p><strong>Possible Causes:</strong> Seems to be an issue with data getting to the query, the query is correct when checked with phpmyadmin, however it is nonfunctional</p>
                    <h4>Next Steps:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verify query execution for inserting into the `shared_events` table.</li>
                        <li>More styling, dark mode is functional but not the prettiest</li>
                        <li>Currently trying to decide how to allow a parent to have control over a childs calendar</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>2. Implementation of methods to prevent users from overloading another with requests</h3>
                    <h3>3. Implementation of a stats page for admin users</h3>
